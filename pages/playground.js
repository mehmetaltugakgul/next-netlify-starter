              2 years back when Neumorphism was trending, I tried my hand out on
              learning the style by reimagining Instagram in Neumorphic style.
              I`ll say it came out pretty well! It`s amazing how much difference
              just two sets of shadows can bring in. I have glassmorphism,
              brutalism and minimalism next!

              With the launch of macOS Big Sur and iOS 14, there is a surge in
              demand for custom icons! Big Sur introduced depth and shadows to
              many default icons, but not all. I decided to take this as an
              opportunity to learn shadows, lighting and depth, and created a
              few custom icons! All these icons were made using Sketch.
